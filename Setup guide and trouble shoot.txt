GUIDE FOR SETTING UP TRACK IT 

THIS GUIDE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND MAY NOT COVER ALL PROCESSES. 


- Get reading from DAC board 
 Usually when you setup trackit you place your sensor input into ai0 and ground. 
 It may happen that it is occupied by another sensor, thus you are forced to use another analog port. 
 If you use another analog port like ai4 you need to alter the script for Python to understand that 
 it have to read from the port. 
 
 1. To do that open the file daqmxlib.py by right clicking it and press "Edit in IDLE" 
 2. press cntr + f 
 3. write channels_samples={"ai
   you will be directed to a place in the code where the channel of the analog port is defined by "aix"
   where x is a number. 
 4. on the line where you found aix replace aix with the analog port you wish to read the signal from 
    like "ai4".
 5. press cntr + s or save the file in a different way. 
 6. open meny.py and test whether or not you have established the communication you want.
