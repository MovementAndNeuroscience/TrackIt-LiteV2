How to set up a new computer with tracking script:

1. Download and unzip the script folder.

2. Install python 2.7.x (some number) from -> https://www.python.org/downloads/ DO NOT INSTALL PYTHON 3

3. Install NiDAQ drivers: get the installation file "NIDAQ961f1.exe", run it (self-extract will occur) and then run a typical installation. It requires a restart of the computer.

4. Run cmd as administrator 
	press windows button 
	Type "cmd"
	Right click command prompt - choose "Run as administrator"

5. In the command prompt the directory you are currently looking at is "C:\WINDOWS\system32"
   We want to go to this directory "C:\Python27\scripts"
   From this folder we can install all the different packages Python needs to be able to run Track-it
	Now, in the command prompt type "cd.."
	It sends you to the folder above which is "C:\WINDOWS"
	again write "cd.."
	Now you are at the C drive 
	Write "cd python27"
	The command promt has traversed into the folder Python27
	now write "cd scripts"
	We are now landed where we want to be 

6. Install python packages that are missing for Track-it to work   
   we do it with the help of pip, which is pythons package installer  
   (type "pip install NAME_OF_THE_PACKAGE", e.g "pip install pygame" ):

- pygame (pip install pygame)

- PyDAQmx (pip install PyDAQmx, etc.)

- numpy

- Pillow

- desktopmagic

- pywin32


7. In the command prompt we need to install a supplementary item, which pip cannot help us with
	write "pywin32_postinstall.py -install"
   
8. Now you are ready to try Track-it_litev2 (if you are on a win10 machine choose the folder trackit_litev2_win10)


ATTENTION: NEVER UPDATE NIMAX!!!
