Welcome to TRACK IT! programme. Now you can perform plenty of customized exercises with force sensor, see the results and their analyses
and archive all the data by one click!

1. MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES

The programme allows one to perform the following actions:

- run a single stationary exercise, or a series of such,
- run a "quest-mode" exercise, with stationary track but moving rectangles,
- start the server, rendering the results via http(REST),
- view the results, both directly in a form of text and browsing the server contents in the default webbrowser,
- save all the data (samples, values, Excel data and plots),
- clear recently captured results,
- view this help.

2. PREPARING AND RUNNING EXERCISES

In order to enjoy properly the astonishing capabilities of TRACK IT! one has to remember that the exercises have to be clearly defined before
run. 

2.1 PREPARING A STATIONARY EXERCISE

A stationary exercise requires the following:

-> number of repetitions: if more than 1 a series of identical runs will be performed (NOTE: Multi-run? option MUST be checked,
otherwise only 1 run will occur).

-> Feedback?: if checked, a feedback in form of numerical score representation will be visible during the exercise,

-> Spawn mode: how the rectangles should be generated; Random -> new random setting, Last setting -> repeat recently spawned
set, Custom -> rectangles' positions to be explicitly defined by the user,

-> rectangle height, expressed in pixels. This value MUST be greater than 0 and should be chosen carefully, as too high rectangles will be shrinked.
The height of the exercise screen is always 1000px.

-> number of random rectangles: up to 10,

-> Type series values: if Custom mode chosen, here the upper height coordinate of each rectangle should be typed

-> fb times: valid, if feedback is selected,

-> length of the exercise: can be chosen from 1 to 12 seconds.

2.2 PREPARING QUEST EXERCISE

One should set the following parameters:

-> number of series: how many predefined series of rectangles should appear (0 means that only random rectangles remain),

-> type series values: upper height coordinates of all the series members should be put (similarly as in 2.1),

-> series first?: if checked series will precede randomly generated rectangles, otherwise the other way round.

-> number of random rectangles: 0 or more randomly spawned rectangles,

-> rectangle width: a positive number determining rectangle width in pixels,

-> rectangles height: see 2.1.

2.3 RUNNING THE EXERCISE

Once all the parameters are correctly set, one may start the exercise by clicking "Start normal exercise"/"Start quest exercise" button. 

IMPORTANT: After clicking start a new window will appear. Tracking is suspended until ENTER is pressed, so that the window can be calmly 
positioned in the secondary display.

The first phase of each run is a delay, which lasts "time after fb" seconds. The actual line tracking starts right after the sound generated
by the programme is audible. When the line reaches the end of the screen, after "time to fb" seconds the percentage of correct track will be
displayed (for "fb time" seconds). Then next runs follow, in the cast of last (or single) run the window will automatically close. Afterwards
all the collected data will be accessible from the program, as well as from the webserver.

IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that one does not close the exercise window before the end of the series, as in such a case the results
may be not generated.

3. VIEWING THE RESULTS

TRACK IT! generates the following information for each exercise:

-> main exercise parameters: date and time, number of rectangles, duration;

-> the percentage of the time the line was fitting the rectangles;

-> the precision with respect to each rectangle (standard deviation expressed as the percentage of rectangle's height);

-> inaccuraccy per rectangle, i.e. how far did the line go from the rectangle center - expressed as the percentage of halved rectangle's 
height;

-> slew rate per rectangle, how long did it take to reach the next rectangle from the previous one (percentage of rectangle's width);

-> a plot showing the object's performance, in a form of screenshot (PNG file),

-> a .txt file, suitable to be opened in Excel for further analysis.

-> a .txt file, containing raw samples.

Some of the aforementioned quantities are accessible from the main window (they are simply displayed on the main text field). 
In order to refresh the text field content one may click "Update results" button. The newest results are appended to the existing ones.
Clicking "Clear data" removes all the content of the text field. Also all the recently generated plots will be deleted.
Should one want to archive a group of exercises (plots and statistics), "Save data" button saves all in a new, timestamped folder.
One of the files, namely 'results_excel.txt', generated by the programme, may be dragged onto MS Excel's empty spreadsheet in order to 
fill Excel cells with experiments' data.
IMPORTANT: Once saved by "Save data", the files in timestamped folders shall not be affected by "Clear data" button!

4. USING WEB INTERFACE

Not only does TRACK IT! present the exercises' output in a form of plot or text, but also it provides a simple REST server, presenting statistical
values in a form of table and historical performance analysis in a form of line graph. In order to delight oneself with this feature one ought to
perform the following steps:

-> clicking "Run Webserver" button,

-> clicking "View the Website" button.

The latter button automatically forwards one to the default web browser and queries the main page of the website. The user may navigate between
the table and the graph via hyperlink.

IMPORTANT: the source of data for Web server is the track is 'track_results.json' file and therefore only recent data, i.e. data not saved via
"Save data" button, will be presented. In order to see previously saved data one has to replace 'track_results.json' file in main directory with
identically named file from the timestamped folder.
It has to be noticed that the server cannot present the data and shows errors when the file is empty, so one CANNOT browse the website without
running any exercise, when previous data have been cleared!

5. MISCELLANEOUS

Clicking "View help" allows one to display this document. Clicking "About" displays some information about the programme and its author.

IMPORTANT: Please remember about closing the server console when done with the programme. The web server instance does not close automatically!
